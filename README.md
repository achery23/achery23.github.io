## Purpose

_This is tentative_.
The purpose of this project is to provide access to, educate others on, and illuminate the importance of African American and Anglophone Caribbean feminist literary traditions and anticolonial aesthetics. I hope for the website to be a working library filled with texts that have been formative to my thinking about the intersections between race, gender, nation, history, and disability in the U.S., the Caribbean and beyond.
